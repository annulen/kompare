Yes, that's really a Vim Komponent :)
Yes, you can have Vim inside KDE apps, you guessed it :)

So, it's designed for KDE 3.x (if someone wants to port it to KDE 2 that
should be easy), it uses GVim or KVim (even Motif Vim works) 6.x.
It can be used in different apps : 
	- KDevelop (version 3)
	- Konqueror (as a file viewer)
	- KWrite
	- KMail (coming in KDE 3.2)
	- Kompare, KBabel ........ ;)

CONFIGURATION
=============
once you compiled and installed it as any other app, 
start your KDE Control Center, go to the file manager section
and open the Vim Component configuration module.
Here, you have to select a Vim executable which may be found on 
your computer (generally /usr/bin/vim) will do it fine for most
linux distributions. All you need is that it's a GUI-enabled Vim 6.0 or
better.
Push the test button, if that's okay then that's should be enough to start
using it :)

FUNCTIONMENT
============
Philippe Fremy (pfremy@kde.com) wrote the initial version of this kpart.
The concept is to start a normal GUI Vim (like gvim), then "embeds" the Vim
window into a KDE Widget.
It used to be based on the ClientServer feature of Vim (type :help
clientserver in Vim for more info) using external processus to control the
embedded Vim. That was running quite fine, but was slow :/
We changed that :)
Now we communicate directly from the kpart to the embedded Vim thanks to X11
without using externals processus. That's much faster and reliable ;)
KVim has also another remote control system using KDE's DCOP communication
backend.
Currently I would advice people to use DCOP when running KVim and using X11
communication with GVim (DCOP won't work with GVim anyway).
There may be some differences in speed, though I have not noticed it here.
The most important difference is that DCOP provides a signal system and that can
make a difference to improve the interaction between KVim and the hosting
application (KDevelop for example). But it's not yet used.

Hope you'll enjoy Vim inside KDE :)
